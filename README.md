## Project Challenges
1. I did not have a clear mind about the application purpose, and not sure about what I wanted the application to look like. After some brainstorming, research and discussion, I finally decided to start with basic version instead of having a big picture in mind but don't know where to start.
2. I wanted to create ManytoMany relationship in JPA, did some effort but still did not make it work, so finally gave up this feature in the project, hope I could make it work in future versions.

## Special Thanks ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜ŠðŸ¥°
- Dhrubo: helped me to brainstorm and think what is my application purpose.
- Julio: gave me advice and ideas about the application features, helped me debug and explain to me whenever I had any issues.
